# Instructions
- Always use niverpay_db.sql file to understand the database structure.

Anytime an update is done in API/ folder, the Readme.md file should be updated to reflect the changes in the API endpoints. (But only if the changes are significant, such as adding new endpoints or modifying existing ones. Minor changes like bug fixes or performance improvements may not require an update to the Readme.md file.)
